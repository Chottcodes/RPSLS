play/BestOf1

1. GamePlay Smith is not working. I can click on the buttons, but nothing happens
2. Unsure why, but in Morpheus gameplay I had to click a few times before it begins to register my clicks
3. I am able to play beyond 1 round. Try again simply clears the counters

play/Bestof5

1. I am able to play beyond 5 rounds. I was getting ties up until the 7th round

play/Bestof7

1. OK. I screenshot the event where I played more than 7 rounds. Check assets. Check it out

multiplayer/BestOf1

1. Link to home is broken
2. Replay is inconsistent. I can't seem to get it to work everytime.

multiplayer/BestOf5

1. Clean up the logic for ties. If there are enough ties then the game goes beyond the intended amount of rounds. Pic in assets
2. I noticed players can technically undo their first choice by clicking another button. Maybe find a way to hide options once a player selected something, so they don't go back and change their choice

multiplayer/BestOf7

1. the ties issue isn't an issue here. However, the 2nd issue from bestof5 is still present.

If I wasn't clear on anything. Let me know and ask for clarifications. I wouldn't mind taking the time to fursther clear things up or explaining what I meant.
